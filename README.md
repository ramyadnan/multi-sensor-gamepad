# Project: Customizable Game Controller with Adaptive Sensors

This repository contains the code and resources for the project featured in the Instructables tutorial, **Customisable Game Controller with Adaptive Sensors Build Guide**. In this project, I create a game controller that incorporates sensors to track hand-grip pressure, motion, and emotional responses, providing valuable real-time data for HCI research and gaming analysis.

The project aims to assist developers and researchers in building a reliable device for measuring player analytics in gaming.

## Contents of This Repo:
 1. Arduino Code: Code to interface with sensors and send data via serial communication.
 2. Python Code: Code for logging and visualising the sensor data.
 3. C++ Code: Code for joystick event polling using SDL3.
 4. STL Files: 3D models for the clipper with a breadboard holder (optional step).
